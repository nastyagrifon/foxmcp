## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **A request monitor started after an earlier one was stopped now captures again.** Stopping the last monitor removed the extension's `webRequest` listeners, and starting a new monitor re-added them - but on Firefox 156 a listener added back after a removal never fires again. Every monitor started after the first stop/start cycle therefore reported itself active and captured nothing until the extension was reloaded, even with a catch-all pattern over known-active traffic: two sessions captured normally, then six consecutive later ones captured nothing in 8-45 s windows. There is no `webRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged()` in MV2 to force a re-registration, so the listeners are now registered once for the extension's lifetime and never removed. While no monitor is active they cost four no-op callbacks per request, and `handleWebRequestEvent()`/`captureResponseBody()` return immediately when `activeMonitors` is empty.
- **A request monitor started while an older one is running no longer reads zero.** The extension keeps one record per request id, shared by every monitor that matches it, and a single flag on that record meant the first monitor to match claimed the request outright. Every later monitor listed nothing for as long as the older one stayed active, and a monitor only goes away when `requests_stop_monitoring` names it. What a client sees is a monitor that captures nothing, and since the natural response is to start another one, it then captures nothing however many times it retries. Each monitor now tracks the requests it has listed for itself, so a request matching three monitors appears in all three, which is what [`docs/web-request-monitoring.md`](docs/web-request-monitoring.md#url-patterns) already described. Reported in [issue #7](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/7).
- **`<all_urls>` as a URL pattern now matches every request instead of none.** Patterns here are globs, not WebExtensions match patterns, so `<all_urls>` carried no wildcard and was tested against each URL as the literal string it is. It is the spelling anyone who has written a WebExtension reaches for first, and it failed silently: a monitor that starts, reports itself active, and never captures anything. It is special-cased alongside the bare `*` now.
- **One press of Reconnect no longer leaves the extension cycling its connection.** The popup's **Reconnect** button and its settings save both close the WebSocket and open a new one, but `onclose` could not tell a deliberate close from a dropped connection, so it scheduled a reconnect as well. That timer then closed the healthy socket it found and opened another, whose close scheduled the next: a connect/close cycle every **Retry Interval**, 5 seconds by default, that ran until the browser was restarted. Nothing stopped it, because the 50-attempt ceiling counts from the last successful connection and every cycle connected successfully. The visible cost is on the server, which logs a connection open and closed every few seconds, and in tool calls that land in the gap between two sockets and fail or time out. A close now only schedules a reconnect if the socket that closed is still the live one.

### Changed
- **A request monitor now ends with whoever started it.** Monitors live in the extension, which outlives every server and every client, and only the client that started one knows its `monitor_id` - so a monitor left behind could never be read or stopped again while it went on holding the extension's `webRequest` listeners up and filtering response bodies for a reader that was gone. Two things end one now, on top of `requests_stop_monitoring`: the MCP client that started it disconnecting, which the server notices within a few seconds and stops that client's monitors and no one else's; and the extension losing its connection to the server, which clears every monitor it holds along with their captured data. Under `--stdio` those are the same event, since the server lives and dies with its client. `requests_list_captured` answers `MONITOR_NOT_FOUND` for an id that has been cleared rather than an empty list, because an empty list is also what a healthy monitor returns before anything has completed. As a backstop, a monitor named in anything the extension says that no client owns is stopped on sight, which covers the two halves drifting apart - an extension too old to clear its monitors when a connection ends, against a server that expects it to. See [`docs/web-request-monitoring.md`](docs/web-request-monitoring.md#how-long-a-monitor-lives).
- **`navigation_reload` and `requests_list_captured` say when their results are ready.** Both tool descriptions now name the trap behind the fixes above: `navigation_reload` returns when the reload is issued rather than when the page has loaded, and a request reaches `requests_list_captured` only once it has completed, so listing immediately after a navigation returns an empty list from a monitor that is working.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- **`--stdio` serves MCP on stdin and stdout, so a client can launch the server itself.** Most MCP clients — Claude Code and Claude Desktop among them — start their servers as child processes and speak to them over pipes; FoxMCP only ever listened on HTTP, so it had to be started by hand and left running, which is what [issue #3](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/3) asked about. `claude mcp add --scope project foxmcp -- /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/server/server.py --stdio` is now enough, and the server lives and dies with the client. The extension side is unchanged: the WebSocket server still listens on 8765 and every tool works as it does over HTTP. Since stdout now carries the JSON-RPC framing, all logging goes to stderr and nothing in `server/` may `print()`. `--stdio` with `--mcp-port` or `--no-mcp` is refused rather than silently ignored, and a server that cannot bind the extension's port says which port and why, then exits non-zero — only one server can serve the extension, and in stdio mode every client launches one. Two costs come with the mode, and both follow from the extension being the side that opens the WebSocket connection. Only one server can serve it, and under stdio every client launches its own, so two `claude` sessions at once leaves the second without browser tools. And tying the server's life to a client leaves a gap at each restart, which the extension gives up on after roughly four minutes with no server to reach. See [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md#serving-mcp-over-stdio), [One session at a time](docs/configuration.md#one-session-at-a-time) and [The reconnect gap](docs/configuration.md#the-reconnect-gap) for what to set and when to prefer HTTP.
- **`--enable-tools` keeps one tool out of a group you disabled.** Disabling a group is all-or-nothing, and sometimes a single tool in it is the one worth its tokens: [issue #6](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/6) asked for a screenshot of the page without the five tab tools that manage tabs, for driving a single-page app. `python server/server.py --disable-tools tabs --enable-tools tabs_capture_screenshot` now does exactly that, and `FOXMCP_ENABLE_TOOLS` does the same for clients that launch the server through a wrapper. The names are the ones the client sees; one that matches no tool is an error, since the symptom would otherwise be the one tool you asked for quietly missing. `tabs_capture_screenshot` is worth naming as the example because it captures the visible tab and takes no tab ID, so it stands on its own — most other tools take a `tab_id` that in practice comes from `tabs_list`. See [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md#keeping-one-tool-out-of-a-disabled-group).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-14

**This release removes `get_last_focused_window` and seven protocol action names.**
No caller can observe a behavior difference from the tool removal — the tool it
duplicated returns the same window — but a client that names it by hand now gets an
error. See **Removed** below.

### Security
- **Extension WebSocket now accepts only `moz-extension://` origins.** Previously any inbound connection was accepted as the extension. WebSocket handshakes are exempt from the same-origin policy and are never preflighted, so any web page the user visited could connect to the localhost port, displace the real extension — an arriving connection closes the existing one — and answer requests on its behalf with content of its choosing. Non-extension connections are now rejected with a 403 during the handshake, and logged.

  Test clients that stand in for the extension must send an extension origin; use `connect_as_extension()` from `tests/test_config.py`.

### Added
- **`--disable-tools` leaves a tool group unregistered, to keep it out of an MCP client's context.** Every tool description a client is offered stays in its context for the whole session whether or not the tool is ever called, and the full set costs roughly 4,700 tokens — the concern raised in [issue #4](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/4). The groups are `windows`, `tabs`, `bookmarks`, `navigation`, `content`, `requests`, `history` and `debug`, and all of them remain on by default, so nothing changes for an existing setup. `python server/server.py --disable-tools bookmarks,history` drops nine tools and about 1,000 tokens; `FOXMCP_DISABLE_TOOLS` does the same for clients that launch the server through a wrapper whose arguments you cannot control. An unrecognized group name is an error rather than a warning, because a typo that quietly left the group enabled would defeat the point. See [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md#reducing-the-tool-surface) for the per-group cost.
- **`tabs_move` — move tabs to a new position, or into another window.** Takes one tab ID, a list, or a JSON string of IDs, with `index` as the destination (`-1` for the end) and an optional `window_id`. Together with `create_window` this covers gathering the tabs for one site into a window of their own, which was the request in [issue #2](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/2) — see [`docs/api-reference.md`](docs/api-reference.md#gathering-tabs-into-their-own-window). Firefox refuses some moves without reporting an error, so the result says `Moved {n} of {m}` rather than claiming success.
- **`tabs_list` takes a `window_id`, and reports where each tab sits.** The parameter that was supposed to scope the listing never worked — a `|| true` in the extension made the current-window filter unconditional, so tabs in other windows could not be listed at all, despite the tool documenting itself as listing every tab. An unscoped call now spans every window, as documented, and each line ends with `[window {id}, index {n}]`.
- **A regression test for the MCP port's web-unreachability.** The port has no authentication, and what keeps web pages off it — absent CORS headers, content-type enforcement, and a session id the browser cannot read — is behavior of `fastmcp`/uvicorn rather than of FoxMCP. `tests/integration/test_mcp_port_not_web_reachable.py` asserts all three, so a dependency upgrade that re-opens the port fails the suite instead of passing quietly. No CORS policy was added: the door is already shut, and hand-rolling one risks breaking legitimate MCP clients.
- **Releases are built in public, and say where they came from.** Previously the XPI and server zip were built on the maintainer's machine and uploaded, so installing them meant taking his word that they matched the source — the concern in [issue #1](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/1). Pushing a `v*` tag now builds them on GitHub Actions from the tagged commit and publishes a signed provenance statement alongside them, which anyone can check without trusting us: `gh attestation verify 'foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi' --repo ThinkerYzu/foxmcp`. `SHA256SUMS` ships as a release asset too. The copy served by addons.mozilla.org is not covered, because Mozilla re-signs the file when it accepts a submission; verify the GitHub asset instead.
- **Audit logging for predefined scripts.** `content_execute_predefined` is the one tool that runs a program on the host, and it previously logged nothing at all — a refused path-traversal attempt and a routine call were equally invisible. Each invocation now logs the script name, arguments and tab at `INFO`, followed by the size of the generated JavaScript and the URL it ran against; every refusal and failure logs at `WARNING`. Arguments are truncated at 120 characters, and the generated JavaScript is never written to the log. See [`docs/scripts.md`](docs/scripts.md#what-gets-logged).

### Removed
- **`release-commands.sh`, the pre-CI release script.** Since 1.2.0 a pushed tag is the entire release, so the script had no job left — but it was worse than idle: it ran `git add -A`, committed the working tree under a "Release v1.1.0" message, and tried to create the `v1.1.0` tag that already exists. It also printed installation instructions that stopped working long ago (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, a repository URL that does not resolve). Everything it did is now in `.github/workflows/release.yml` and `scripts/release-notes.sh`. Nothing referenced it.
- **Seven protocol action names the extension accepted but nothing sent.** Five were old spellings kept as fall-through aliases beside the names that replaced them — `bookmarks.remove`, `content.execute`, `content.html`, `content.text` and `navigation.go`, alongside `bookmarks.delete`, `content.execute_script`, `content.get_html`, `content.get_text` and `navigation.go_to_url`. No tool had sent the old names since before v1.0.0, and their only remaining mention was an unreferenced dispatch table in the test harness, since deleted. The sixth, `tabs.active`, had its own handler returning the active tab of the current window; `tabs_list` reaches the same `browser.tabs.query` and reports the `active` flag, so it added nothing. The seventh, `test.create_test_tabs`, was a test fixture that bulk-created tabs by going around the MCP layer; its only caller was replaced by `tabs_create` in September 2025 — which exercises the layer under test instead of bypassing it — and the handler was left behind. It is the only `test.*` action that never had a method on the server side, and no assertion has ever covered its result. `tabs.update` is deliberately kept: nothing else can change a tab's URL or pinned state in place.
- **`get_last_focused_window`, which could never have returned anything different from `get_current_window`.** Firefox's `ext-windows.js` reads `context.currentWindow || windowTracker.topWindow` for `windows.getCurrent()` and plain `windowTracker.topWindow` for `windows.getLastFocused()`, and `ExtensionParent.sys.mjs` returns `undefined` for `currentWindow` whenever the calling context's `viewType` is `"background"` — the only context this extension has. Both calls therefore evaluated the same expression, and the two tools have returned the same window since v1.0.0. Use `get_current_window`; its description now says it is also the last focused window. Spotted by the reporter of [issue #4](https://github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp/issues/4), who proposed merging the two behind a fallback — the fallback turned out to already be inside `getCurrent`, and to be its only reachable branch here. The `windows.get_last_focused` protocol action is gone with it.

### Fixed
- **`debug_websocket_status` could never report a connection.** It looked for a `connected_clients` collection on the server, which `FoxMCPServer` has never had — it holds a single `extension_connection`, since an arriving extension displaces the previous one — so the tool answered "WebSocket server doesn't track connected clients" whether or not the extension was connected. That is the tool you reach for when the connection is what you doubt, and every other tool answers a missing extension with a 30-second timeout. It now says whether an extension is connected and from which address, and distinguishes "never connected" from "the last connection has closed". Found by installing the extension into a real Firefox profile by hand and asking.
- **`make run-server` ran whatever `python` was on PATH.** Every other Makefile target runs out of `venv/bin`, but this one did not, so on a machine where `python` is another virtual environment — or is not installed, which is normal now that distributions ship only `python3` — starting the server failed on an import of a dependency that was installed all along. `package.json`'s `start` script had the same bug.
- **`debug_websocket_status` was registered by the history group.** Nothing depended on this while every tool was always registered, but it meant the tool you reach for when the connection looks wrong would have disappeared along with an unrelated group. It has its own group now.
- **Response body capture never captured anything.** The extension tried to read bodies by overriding `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` from a content script, and the override silently did nothing: a content script's `window` is an Xray wrapper, so the assignment landed nowhere and the page kept the native `fetch`. `requests_get_content` therefore returned `included: false` for every request ever made. Bodies now come from `webRequest.filterResponseData`, which taps the response stream in the background script — so the document load is captured too, which the old approach could never have managed, and Firefox has already undone any `Content-Encoding` by the time the bytes arrive. This adds the `webRequestBlocking` permission, which Firefox requires for `filterResponseData`; no listener blocks, cancels or rewrites a request, and the permission carries no new install prompt. At most 200 bodies are held at a time, since a monitor on `*` sees every request the browser makes.
- **`size_bytes` reported 0 for responses whose size was simply unknown.** It was read from `Content-Length`, which compressed HTTP/2 responses routinely omit, with a fallback to `details.responseSize` that returns 0 on Beta and Developer Edition while returning the real figure on Nightly — which is why `test_response_body_capture_verification` passed on the maintainer's machine and failed on CI with no code difference between them. The value is now the bytes actually delivered, counted while the body streams through, and it is correct even when the body itself is withheld for its content type or cut short by `max_body_size`. It is `null`, never 0, when the response could not be tapped at all.
- **A response body, once captured, could not be found again.** When `requests_get_content` had no body stored under the request id it fell back to matching on URL, method and status, comparing against `requestDetail.response_status_code` — a field nothing in the extension ever sets, so the comparison could not succeed. The fallback is gone; bodies are stored under the `webRequest` request id that `requests_list_captured` reports.
- **Tool documentation that MCP clients could not see.** FastMCP builds a tool's description from the docstring summary and body and maps `Args:` onto the input schema, but **discards `Returns:`** — and five tools kept facts a caller needs there. `bookmarks_list` and `bookmarks_search` showed three words each while the ID-and-parent-ID convention that makes `bookmarks_update`/`_delete`/`_create` usable was invisible; `bookmarks_search` never mentioned that it matches bookmarks and never folders. `tabs_capture_screenshot` did not say that its return type changes shape depending on `filename`. `requests_start_monitoring` did not say the response carries the `monitor_id` that its three companion tools require. Those facts are now in the description or on the argument. Twelve other tools have a `Returns:` line that only restates the summary and were left alone.
- **`history_delete_item` raised `NameError` instead of confirming the delete.** Both the success line and the fallback line interpolated `params.url`, but the tool takes `url` directly and has no `params` — a leftover from the Pydantic-model signature the neighbouring navigation tools still use. The delete itself went through, then the tool crashed reporting it, so the caller saw a traceback for work that had already succeeded. Only the error path was under test, which is how it shipped.
- **Release archives kept files that had been deleted from the source tree.** `zip` updates an existing archive rather than replacing it, so once a file entered `foxmcp@codemud.org.xpi` it stayed there through every later build until someone ran `make clean`; the server staging directory was copied into without being cleared and had the same problem. Both are now emptied before each build. `__pycache__` from a local run is also dropped from the server archive, so a build here and a build on CI produce the same contents.

### Documentation
- **The install-from-source instructions did not work.** README told the reader to `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and there is no `requirements.txt` at the repository root — the dependencies live in `server/requirements.txt` and `tests/requirements.txt`. It now says `make install`, which creates `venv/` and installs the server dependencies into it, verified from a fresh clone.
- **Python 3.10 is the floor, and the installer now says so.** `fastmcp` 3 requires it, while `scripts/install-from-github.sh` accepted 3.8 and 3.9 and left pip to fail afterwards with an error that never mentions the Python version. `package.json` claimed `>=3.8` for the same reason. Development and CI run 3.14.
- **Installing an unsigned XPI does not work on release or beta Firefox.** Both enforce extension signing and ignore `xpinstall.signatures.required`; only Nightly, Developer Edition and unbranded builds honour it. README presented the two persistent install methods as if they worked everywhere. They are now marked for what they are, with addons.mozilla.org named as the route for everyone else.
- **`docs/web-request-monitoring.md` documented about twenty tools that were never built** — search, retention policies, storage quotas, session save and load — because the file was an implementation plan presented as reference documentation. It is now a reference for the four tools that exist, covering the pattern syntax, which options do something, where captured data lives and how long it survives.
- **Five parameters are accepted and ignored, and now say so.** `save_request_body_to` and `save_response_body_to` never wrote a file; `include_binary` never changed what came back; `drain_timeout` never delayed a stop; and of the monitoring options, `capture_request_bodies` and `sensitive_headers` are read by nothing. The tool descriptions and the reference docs mark each one rather than leaving a caller to conclude the feature is broken. `requests_get_content` also always returns an empty `request_headers`, which is now documented; no listener collects them.
- **`docs/protocol.md` never documented the `requests.*` messages**, though it presents itself as the complete wire format and the feature shipped in v1.1.0. All four — `start_monitoring`, `list_captured`, `get_content`, `stop_monitoring` — are there now, with their error codes.
- **Neither install path listed its system prerequisites, and both fail without them on a stock Ubuntu.** `make`, `zip` and Python's `venv` module are all absent from a fresh Ubuntu 24.04, so `make install` stopped at "The virtual environment was not created successfully" and `make package` could not build the XPI. README now names them. `scripts/install-from-github.sh` checked for `curl`, `unzip` and `python3` but not for the venv module it uses immediately afterwards: on a machine without `python3-venv` it downloaded and unpacked the whole release, then died on a Python error with no mention of the package to install, leaving five directories and a broken `venv/` behind. It now probes venv creation up front and exits with the apt command to run, before downloading anything.
- **`scripts/install-xpi.sh` told users the extension "should be automatically enabled". It is not.** Firefox installs an extension dropped into a profile from outside the browser in the disabled state and waits for a person to enable it in `about:addons` — verified by installing into a fresh profile and watching the extension sit at `userDisabled: true` while the server logged no connection. The script now says so, as do README's Method 3 and `docs/development.md`; `install-from-github.sh` already did.
- **The repository URL in `package.json` and the extension manifest pointed at a repository that does not exist** (`github.com/foxmcp/foxmcp` rather than `github.com/ThinkerYzu/foxmcp`).
